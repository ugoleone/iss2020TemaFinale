            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            Remember our motto:<br />
            <k>there is no code without a project, no project
                without problem analysis and no problem without requirements</k>.


            <h2>Requirements</h2>

            <div class="remark">
                Design and build a software system to control a DDR (differential drive robot) so that:
                <!--
    <ul>
        <li>
            The robot is able to explore in a systematic and autonomous way a room
        </li>
        <li>
            by showing (in real time) to the user (on a smartphone) a picture of the explored space
        </li>
    </ul>
    -->
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The robot walk along the boundary of the room, until it reaches the home again
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The robot must be able to react to the commands stop, by 'immediately' stopping the work and the
                        commands resume to continue its goal-work from the point reached before stopping.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>



            <h2>Requirement analysis</h2>
            <div class="remark">
                <ks>GOAL</ks>: <i>i)</i> clarify the meaning of the <i>names</i> and of the <i>verbs</i> included in the
                requirement text given by the customer.
                <i>ii)</i> define a first working prototype (and a first set of <k>functional TestPlan</k>) as a formal
                model of the requirements.

            </div>

            <h2>Problem analysis</h2>
            <div class="remark">
                <ks>GOAL</ks>:
                <i>i)</i>define the <k>logical architecture</k> of the system (hopefully as an executable model)
                <i>ii) measure the <k>abstraction gap</k> and </i>give a <k>quantitative measure of the effort/resources
                </k> necessary to build the system
                <i>iii)</i> refine the set of <k>functional TestPlan</k>,
                <i>iv)</i>define a (first) <k>product backlog</k>.<br /><br />

                <ks>WARNING</ks>: expressions like <i>'we have chosen to ...'</i>, <i>'I decided ...'</i>, etc. are <k>
                    forbidden</k> here. <br />
                Rather, this section should include sentences like
                <b><i>'this (aspect of the) problem implies that ...'</i></b> or <i><b>'the usage of this (legacy)
                        component requires that ...'</i></b>, etc.
                <br />
            </div>

            <h2>Test plans</h2>
            <div class="remark">
                <ks>GOAL</ks>: give a formal description (for example, by using <ks>JUnit</ks>) of the <k>functional
                    TestPlans</k>, with reference to the <k>logical architecture</k> of the system .
            </div>

            <h2>Project</h2>
            <div class="remark">
                <ks>GOAL</ks>: define the concrete architecture of the system and the behavior of each component .
            </div>

            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <div class="remark">
                <ks>GOAL</ks>: complete the <k>functional TestPlans</k> according to the project code and execute them.
            </div>

            <h2>Deployment</h2>

            <div class="remark">
                <ks>GOAL</ks>: prepare a software application to run and operate in a specific environment.
                It involves installation, configuration, testing and making changes to optimize the performance of the
                software.
                It can either be carried out manually or (hopefully) through automated systems.
            </div>



            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <div class="remark">
                <ks>GOAL</ks>: modify the software product after delivery to correct faults,
                to improve performance or other attributes.
                A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects.
                However, one study indicated that over 80% of maintenance effort is used for non-corrective actions.
